Despite the heavy ground fog in the lower valleys, this 70mm handheld camera's photo provides a strikingly detailed view of the Italian, Swiss and Austrian Alps of central Europe.  For example, the famous Brenner Pass, an historic gateway connecting Italy to the rest of Europe, can be seen in the left central foreground.  The Austrian city of Innsbruck on the Inn River, scene of the 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics, and normally visible in great detail, is completely masked by heavy ground fog. Center coordinates of the pictured area are located at 47.5 degrees north latitude and 12.5 degrees east longitude.",

The river over eons has carved out Arizona's mile deep and 270 mile long Grand Canyon.  Prominent in this scene is the Kaibab Plateau at the head of the canyon where the big bend of the Colorado River has eroded the plateau into a peninsula.  This plateau, directly across the canyon from the South Rim Visitor's Center, is at the widest part of the canyon, about 12 miles.  The Kaibab Indian Reservation and the Kaibab National Forest are visible in the picture.",

This event featured both a long flare decay time and a storm of electrically charged, energetic particles. The particles can be seen as bright white specks scattering across the frames. The coronagraph movie shows the cloud of particles expanding in all directions as if it were creating a halo around the Sun.  Data shows that the CME was heading towards Earth that could generate strong aurora displays several days later. In coronagraph images the Sun (represented by the small white circle in the center) is blocked by an occulting disk so that we can observe faint features in the corona and beyond.

The camera has now recorded a full year of life on Earth from its orbit at Lagrange point 1, approximately 1 million miles from Earth, where it is balanced between the gravity of our home planet and the sun.   EPIC takes a new picture every two hours, revealing how the planet would look to human eyes, capturing the ever-changing motion of clouds and weather systems and the fixed features of Earth such as deserts, forests and the distinct blues of different seas. EPIC will allow scientists to monitor ozone and aerosol levels in Earth’s atmosphere, cloud height, vegetation properties and the ultraviolet reflectivity of Earth.   The primary objective of DSCOVR, a partnership between NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Air Force, is to maintain the nation’s real-time solar wind monitoring capabilities, which are critical to the accuracy and lead time of space weather alerts and forecasts from NOAA.

A hair is created when a stream of dark matter particles goes through the planet. According to simulations, the hair is densest at a point called the \"root.\" When particles of a dark matter stream pass through the core of Earth, they form a hair whose root has a particle density about a billion times greater than average.  The hairs in this illustration are not to scale. Simulations show that the roots of such hairs can be 600,000 miles (1 million kilometers) from Earth, while Earth's radius is only about 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers).  http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20176",
